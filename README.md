powershell-profile
==================

My powershell profile, placed in github for easy access

---

To create a symlink so that the powershell $profile directory points to the local copy of this repository...

	mklink /D c:\Users\username\Documents\WindowsPowerShell powershell-profile

Assuming the command above was run from the command line (not powershell) and the current directory is the parent directory of the local copy of this repository.
